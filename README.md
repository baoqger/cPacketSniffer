# network-capture-injection-programming-in-c
network capture and  injection programming in C language based on libpcap  and libnet

Note: This project is based on the following open source [document](http://tcpip.marcolavoie.ca/index.html), which is owned by **Marco Lavoie**. Thanks for sharing this great document. 


The difference between my project and origial project is that I refactor the application in `C` language. The original project is written in `C++`, which is great. But I just want to use this project as a practise to enhance my C programming skills. 

The application developed in this project is the same as the original one: `network packet capture and injection` application on Linux system.
